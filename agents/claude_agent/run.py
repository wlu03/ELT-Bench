"""Claude Code Agent runner for ELT-Bench.

Uses the `claude-agent-sdk` Python SDK to drive Claude against each ELT task
in `../../elt-bench/`. For every database it:

  1. Resets the configured Snowflake, Databricks, or Redshift namespace.
  2. Copies the destination-specific task inputs into the
     per-run output directory, which is mounted as `/workspace` inside a
     fresh `elt_agent-image` Docker container on the `elt-docker_elt_network`.
  3. Launches a Claude Agent SDK session with its `cwd` set to that output
     directory. File tools (Read/Write/Edit/Glob/Grep) operate on the host
     bind mount and appear inside the container automatically. Shell commands
     are routed through a custom `container_bash` MCP tool that runs
     `docker exec` inside the task's container. The native Bash tool (and
     every other host-reaching tool) is disallowed, and a PreToolUse hook
     confines the file tools to the mount: reads anywhere under it, writes
     only under `elt/`. `/workspace/...` paths are rewritten to the mount so
     the model can use the container's view of the tree. User-level settings,
     plugins and MCP servers are not loaded (`setting_sources=[]`,
     `strict_mcp_config`), so nothing from the operator's own Claude Code
     configuration reaches the agent.
  4. Audits the finished trajectory (`claude/sandbox_audit.json`): any call to
     a disallowed tool, any file-tool path outside the mount, and every hook
     denial are recorded; the run is marked `sandbox_clean`.
  5. Streams the trajectory and writes `claude/result.json` with the
     transcript, turn count, cost, and final status.

Usage:
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...           # or use any Claude Code-supported auth
    python run.py --destination databricks --suffix eltbench --model claude-opus-4-7

SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are a data engineer skilled in databases, SQL, and building ELT pipelines.
Your working directory (`cwd`) is the host-side mount of `{container_workdir}` inside a Docker container named `{container}`, running the `{image}` image on the `{network}` network. Any file you create or edit in the cwd appears immediately inside the container at `{container_workdir}`. The cwd contains all the necessary information for your tasks. However, you are only allowed to modify files in `/workspace/elt` (i.e. `<cwd>/elt` on the host).
Your goal is to build an ELT pipeline by extracting data from multiple sources, such as custom APIs, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, flat files, and the cloud service S3.
The extracted data will be loaded into a target system, Databricks, followed by writing transformation queries to construct final tables for downstream use.
This task is divided into two stages:
1. Data Extraction and Loading – Using Airbyte's Terraform provider.
2. Data Transformation – Using the DBT Project workflow for Databricks.

TOOL USAGE:
  - Read / Write / Edit / Glob / Grep: operate on files under the cwd. Prefer these over shell utilities for file I/O.
  - container_bash: run a shell command inside the `{container}` container (cwd = `{container_workdir}`). All commands — terraform, dbt, airbyte-cli, python, psql, etc. — must go through this tool. You do NOT have a host shell; do not try to call `docker`, `docker exec`, or any other host command directly.

First, you should _always_ include a general thought about what you're going to do next.
Then issue the corresponding tool call. Wait for the tool result before continuing with more discussion and commands.
"""

TASK_INSTRUCTION = """We're currently building the ELT pipeline using Airbyte Terraform and DBT. Here's the detailed instruction:

INSTRUCTIONS:
 # Stage 1: Data Extraction and Loading Hints#
1. Initialize the Airbyte Provider: Use /workspace/config.yaml to configure the username, password, and server URL in /workspace/elt/main.tf. You can refer to /workspace/documentation/airbyte_Provider.md, then run `terraform init`.
• Important: You must not modify any provided code in /workspace/elt/main.tf.
2. Configure Sources and Destinations: Use /workspace/config.yaml to set up the listed sources and destinations in in Terraform file located in /workspace/elt. The values in config.yaml represent the actual configurations required for the project.
3. Refer to Documentation for Configuration Guidance: You must consult the Airbyte documentation located in /workspace/documentation to understand how to configure sources and destinations.
• Important: The values in the documentation are for reference only. DO NOT use them directly. And you must not fill the fields with random values or placeholders. Instead, fill in the fields based on the field names in /workspace/documentation and the realistic values specified in /workspace/config.yaml. The field names in /workspace/documentation and /workspace/config.yaml may not match exactly. In such cases, you need to infer values for certain fields. If you forget the realistic values for configuring sources and destinations in Terraform file located in /workspace/elt, you must go back and read /workspace/config.yaml to retrieve them.
4. Establish Connections: After creating sources and destinations, establish connections between them by following /workspace/documentation/connection.md. For each connection, include the name and sync_mode fields in configuration.streams to streamline only the tables defined in /workspace/config.yaml.
5. Apply the Configuration: Once all necessary configurations are written, run `terraform apply` to create the resources.
6. Retrieve Connection IDs: After successfully creating sources, destinations and connections, obtain the connection IDs for all newly created connections from the terraform.tfstate file, as these will be needed to trigger the jobs.
7. Trigger Sync Jobs One by One with Delay: Due to warehouse resource limitations, you must trigger sync jobs one at a time with a 1-minute delay between each trigger. For each connection ID, trigger the job using the Airbyte API (refer to /workspace/documentation/trigger_job.md and use /workspace/config.yaml to retrieve the required values), then wait at least 1 minute (e.g., `sleep 60`) before triggering the next job. Do NOT wait for a job to complete before triggering the next one — just ensure the 1-minute gap between triggers.
8. Monitor Job Status: After all jobs have been triggered, check the status of all jobs by running `python /workspace/check_job_status.py --server <server> --username <username> --password <password>` (replace <server>, <username>, and <password> with the actual values). Keep checking until all jobs have completed. Proceed to the next stage only if all data extraction and loading jobs are successful. If any job fails, fix it and retry before moving on.
9. Error Handling: If an error occurs, DO NOT modify any provided files. Instead, verify the configuration against the provided documentation and review previous steps to identify and resolve the issue. If the issue persists after multiple retries, terminate the task.

#  Stage 2: Data Transformation Hints#
1. Initialize the DBT Project: Set up a new DBT project by configuring it with /workspace/config.yaml, and remove the example directory under the models directory. When you need to connect to Databricks, you must connect through the OAuth machine-to-machine (M2M) authentication method. Refer to databricks_authentication.md for the required configuration details.
2. Understand the Data Model: Review data_model.yaml in /workspace to understand the required data models and their column descriptions. Then, write SQL queries to generate these defined data models, referring to the files in the /workspace/schemas directory to understand the schemas of source tables.
• Important: Write a separate query for each data model, and if using any DBT project variables, ensure they have already been declared.
3. Validate Table Locations: Ensure all SQL queries reference the correct database and schema names for source tables. If you encounter a "table not found" error, refer to /workspace/config.yaml to obtain the correct configuration. If the table does not exist, the issue is likely due to a failure in data extraction and loading in Stage 1, and you should return to Stage 1 to resolve it.
4. Run the DBT Project: Execute `dbt run` to apply transformations and generate the final data models in Databricks, fixing any errors reported by DBT.
5. Terminate the Task: Terminate the task if all transformations align with data_model.yaml and the final tables in Databricks are accurate and verified. Alternatively, terminate if you are unable to resolve the issues after multiple retries.

When done (or giving up), print a single final line:
    RESULT: SUCCESS   — pipeline built and final tables populated
    RESULT: FAIL: <short reason>
